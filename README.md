- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheCoyoteDreams: I'm curious, maybe a bit mischievious, enjoy laughter (usually at my own expense-I don't mind, or maybe others). I'm a Tech Goddess, been in things IT since I got out of college and introduced to AutoCAD 10 in the DOS days when working in architectural drafting & estimating. I dove in and learned DOS, how to customize AutoCAD with DIESEL, AutoLISP and some early database programs. Owned my own IT support business for awhile working in the days of DOS, W3.1/3.11, W95/98 & ME (..shudder..), NT, then a Sr support specialist for 15yrs supporting everything that pretty much plugged in supporting XP, W7, Windows Server, iOS, OS X, macOS. Now I"m less in the field and working more on project managbement and maybe(?) some coding if I can get a round to-it. 

I'm not dropping anyting here on GitHub until I start coding, so mostly I'm looking for other peoples efforts for issues I'd like solved. Just now I found LaunchPadder for macOS which organizes the LaunchPad icons according to the rules setup in the app. This is cool and I'm looking forward to using it. I hope to add a little something like this to the coding universe someday.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... techology hardware advances, Apple ecosystem, troubleshooting & problem solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... project management, working on a PMP (well that's the end goal), some Apple App coding (it's slow)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing currently.
